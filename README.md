# About

**This repository serves as a personal library and learning platform for myself. It is designed to be a refresher project example for myself on Solidity and smart contract development.**

This project was developed with help from Patrick Collins's Foundry Fundamentals course on Cyfrin Updraft. Numerous comments have been transcribed from his excellent explanations of the inner workings of Solidity.

## Content
Library encompasses a variety of Solidity contracts and development practices including:
- Fund Storage & Withdrawal Contract
- Deployment Scripts
- Reminders & Explanatory Comments for Solidity Syntax
- Library Remappings
- Unit & Integration Tests
- Makefile
- Mock Contract

## Requirements
